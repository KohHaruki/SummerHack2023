Assuming you have Docker already set up
1. In the main directory, run docker build -t express-app .
2. Go to client directory, run docker build -t vite-app .
3. Open docker desktop and run the two images that you have just built 
      - express-app with 8080:8080 port 
      - vite-app with 5173:5173 port
